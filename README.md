# Project McGilchrist

> "Not two processors. Two ways of being."  
> — Inspired by the work of Iain McGilchrist

**Project McGilchrist** is an experimental cognitive architecture that simulates left and right hemispheric reasoning styles through modular AI agents. The project explores what happens when a system is designed not to converge on a single answer — but to reflect, negotiate, and synthesize internal dialogue.

## What It Does

- **Left Hemisphere Agent**: Logical, literal, reductive, task-oriented  
- **Right Hemisphere Agent**: Associative, metaphorical, intuitive, context-sensitive  
- **Corpus Callosum Engine**: Merges or contrasts responses, revealing convergence or cognitive dissonance  
- **Prompt-Based Interaction**: Feed the system real-world questions and observe internal dialectics in motion

## Why It Matters

Project McGilchrist isn’t about simulating consciousness — it’s about **structuring thought** in a way that mirrors **the divided human mind**.  
Inspired by Iain McGilchrist’s _The Master and His Emissary_, this prototype invites inquiry into:

- Cognitive asymmetry  
- Synthesis vs. domination  
- Meaning beyond mere function  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Modular agent design  
- No external dependencies required (Mk1 / Mk2)

---

## Future Directions

- Emotional tone modulation  
- Memory accumulation per hemisphere  
- Conflict resolution logic  
- Dynamic synthesis weightings
